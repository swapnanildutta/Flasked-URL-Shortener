# Flasked-URL-Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener that uses a Flask Backend and is capable of shortening URLs as well as links for files. This also stores session history, incase you forget what you did recently. ðŸ˜µ

## How to Use

- Fork this repository and download using _git clone_.
  ```bash
  $git clone https://github.com/<username>/Flasked-URL-Shortener.git
  ```
- Install all the dependencies.

  ```powershell
  $pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  or,

  ```bash
  $pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  Or, you may use _pipenv_ or even _virtualenv_, if you don't want to install dependencies in your global setup.

  ```bash
  $pip3 install pipenv
  $pipenv install
  $pipenv shell
  $pipenv install flask
  ```

- Now run the web app.

  ```bash
  $export FLASK_ENV=development
  $export FLASK_APP=urlshort
  $flask run
  ```

  This will be followed up with this kind of output:

  ```bash
